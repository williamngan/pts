# Pts

Pts is a typescript/javascript library for visualization and creative-coding. 

**Get started at [ptsjs.org](https://ptsjs.org)**.

Please give it a try, [file issues](https://github.com/williamngan/pts/issues), and send feedbacks to [@williamngan](https://twitter.com/williamngan). Thank you!

### Usage

**Option 1**   
Get the latest `pts.js` or `pts.min.js` (in [dist](https://github.com/williamngan/pts/tree/master/dist) folder). Alternatively use a CDN service like [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/pts) or [jsdelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/williamngan/pts/dist/pts.min.js) or [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/pts/dist/pts.min.js). Then add it to your html page like this:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/pts.js"></script>
```
Pts is pretty lightweight. Currently at ~100kb minified and 30kb gzipped.


**Option 2:**   
Install via `npm install pts`. Then you can choose to import some parts of Pts into your project as needed. 
```js
import {CanvasSpace, Pt, Group, Line} from 'pts';
```

To quickly get started, try download or clone these repos:
- [pts-starter-kit](https://github.com/williamngan/pts-starter-kit): Get started with a sample app using npm and webpack
- [pts-react-example](https://github.com/williamngan/pts-react-example): Try an example of using Pts with React.
- [react-pts-canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-pts-canvas): Use it in your React project by extending react-pts-canvas component

**Get Started**   
Read the [guides](https://ptsjs.org/guide/get-started-0100) and take a look at the [demos](https://ptsjs.org/demo/?name=circle.intersectCircle2D) and their source code.    
If you need help, please don't hesitate to [file an issue](https://github.com/williamngan/pts/issues).
